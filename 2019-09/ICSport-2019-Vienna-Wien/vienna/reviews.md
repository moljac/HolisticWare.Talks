This paper compares several supervised classifier algorithms for somatotype data. The experiments were carried 
out using the Microsoft Azure Machine Learning platform and ML.net library. The paper does not convince me 
scientifically and is poorly written. Major comments: 

1.  The authors should clearly specify the scientific contribution. 
2.  There are many language errors at the paper, for publishing, the professional proofreading should be 
    carried out. 
3.  Criteria (1) (2) (3) appear to be incorrect, I have checked several sources (also Azure documentation) and 
    they are defined differently than at the paper. Please correct them or add the appropriate reference. 
4. There are no details about the used dataset, in the paper should be clearly defined on what number of data 
    the algorithms were trained and tested.

The authors compares several machine learning algorithms for somatotype classification. I my opinion this 
research will be an important resource for other researchers in this area. Whole paper is interesting and well 
writing. Minor comments: - abstract does not contain information about material, results and conclusions, - 
The data used for the analysis is not real but was generated on the basis of previous work. I am asking for a 
more detailed description of this data. What parameters are given to the model input (what the training vector 
for the classifier looks like).

Paper describes results of an research relevant to the Conference topics and is worth presenting. Paper could 
be accepted with certain corrections. 
Particular comments
    
1.  Though described research is of definite relevance to the topic of the Conference you should stress it 
    specifically in the Abstract and in the text! Also, you need to add briefly the conclusions from your research 
    into the Abstract! 
2.  Materials and Methods This chapter leaves few important questions you need to address: 

    -   which computer was used to run the software 

    -   how large is the computational load when using chosen algorithms (computation time or anything alike) 
    
    -   what exactly are the data you are using (literally, which parameters did you feed into your software, 
    
    -   how large is the sample etc .) - make it explicit, 
    
    -   were you making any changes into the Microsoft software (you are claiming in the last line of the conclusions: 
        "... Current efforts are focused to add components for data acquisition, so more tests and research could be done. ...", 
        which can make an impression that you have some modifications or intend to introduce them 
        
3. Text refers to wrong expressions, references to (1) and (2) are mixed up

The paper applies several machine learning (ML) methods to one classification task (somatotype classification). 
Although somatotype classification may have a relation to sport science, this paper does not provide any useful 
contribution in regard of somatotype classification. That classification problem has a well-known and established 
solution by a formula that computes features from body measurements and also does the classification explicitly. 
So ML cannot help with this and the intended contribution rather seems to be the comparison of ML methods. 
But then, for a well-founded comparison, one example task is not enough, many tasks should be considered. 
Aside from that, the methodology to study and compare ML methods based on example tasks is of inadequate. 
The training and testing data is artificially generated (without giving the necessary details required to reproduce 
the data), which may well lead to a biased result. There is no reference to or comparison with previous work 
that compares performances for ML algorithms. There is no consideration of parameters of the ML methods and of 
the tradeoff between complexity and prediction quality. The text is too long, unnecessarily given vague overviews 
over the whole field, the diagrams in Figs. 1 and 2 are not appropriate (inputs/outputs should be vectors, not 
functions), and do not explain anything. The text in general is poorly written.

x(t) - input vector (or scalar for 1-dimensional vectors) that varies in time
y(t) - output vector (or scalar for 1-dimensional vectors) that varies in time

You can use $$\LaTeX$$ to typeset formulas. A formula can be displayed inline, e.g. $$e=mc^2$$, or as a block:
$$\int_\Omega \nabla u \cdot \nabla v~dx = \int_\Omega fv~dx$$

Introduction - Give a short definition of kinanthroplogy - What is the difference between machine learning and 
deep learning? It is not clear in the introduction. - Objectives of the study are not clear for the reader. 

Please rephrase. Method 

-   What were the data compare with these algorithms? Results 

-   Analysis of confusion matrix must be presented in method section (4 figures!!!) 

-   Presion and recall results are not presented in this section - type 1 and type 2 errors must be explain 

- .. in order to achieve better performance (precision and speed)..: no speed data are presented in this manuscrit. 
    If it is an important parameter to compare your algorythm (on my side I think it is), add this parameter in 
    the method section and show speed data in the results section 
    
Discussion:
    
-   No section, discussion of the results is made in the conclusion section. Please re-oganise. 

Conclusion:

 -  "..are already close to the desired acuracy": please specify the desired accuracy in the method section and 
    justify this threshold

too many "some"s in your text I don not understand your split of the given data into 75% training and 25% test; 
you could have used four bins of 25% each, and cross-validate training/testing, which the yield even statistics 
about the result mapping error the portion of the paper that directly refers to the icsports core topic is 
rather weak compared to the broad explanation of the very basics of control theory
